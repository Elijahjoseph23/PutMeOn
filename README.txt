Instructions:
-----------------------------------------
- create a spotify project (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started)

- find your project's Client ID and Client Secret

- create a .env file with the following text:
CLIENT_ID="<YOUR CLIENT ID HERE>"
CLIENT_SECRET="<YOUR CLIENT SECRET HERE>"

- when running the program, make sure your queue is cleared as well as that a song is playing before running. If there
is no active device, the program will not work

- WHEN FINISHED, ALWAYS CLOSE OUT THE PROGRAM USING THE ‚ùå (X) BUTTON. The way this program works is that it locally stores 
the songs you dislike in order for the program to more accurately predict what songs you like

- here's what each button does
    - üëç (thumbs up button): Adds the song to your playlist
    - ‚èØÔ∏è (pause/play button): Pauses/Plays the song
    - üëé (thumbs down button): Skips the song, adds it to a list of songs you don't like so that the program can make more accurate predictions
    - ‚ùå (X button): Exits the program
