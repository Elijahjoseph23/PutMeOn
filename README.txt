Instructions:
-----------------------------------------
- create a spotify app (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started)

- find your project's Client ID and Client Secret

- create a .env file with the following text:
CLIENT_ID="<YOUR CLIENT ID HERE>"
CLIENT_SECRET="<YOUR CLIENT SECRET HERE>"

- when running the program, make sure your queue is cleared as well as that a song is playing before running. If there
is no active device, the program will not work

- run the Main.py file, allow the permissions on the link it forwards you too

- enter the name of the playlist you want to add more songs to (make sure to type it exactly how it appears on Spotify)

- here's what each button does:
    - üëç (thumbs up button): adds the song to your playlist, then skips the song
    - ‚èØÔ∏è (pause/play button): pauses/plays the song
    - üëé (thumbs down button): skips the song, adds it to a list of songs you don't like so that the program can make more accurate predictions
    - ‚ùå (X button): exits the program

- WHEN FINISHED, ALWAYS CLOSE OUT THE PROGRAM USING THE ‚ùå (X) BUTTON. The way this program works is that it locally stores 
the songs you dislike in order for the program to more accurately predict what songs you like
